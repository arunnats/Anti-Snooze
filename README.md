## Introduction
Drowsy driving poses a significant risk on the roads, leading to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities.

Installed on the steering wheel, it analyzes the driver's heart rate to provide warnings and wake-up alerts, ensuring safe journeys.

## What Sets Us Apart
Our device stands out from the competition in two key ways:

Secure Attachment: Attached to the steering wheel for safety and convenience.
User-Friendly: No need to carry or wear it, ensuring ease of use and fashionability.
Moreover, it is cost-effective, aiming to make drowsiness prevention accessible to every driver.

## Working
The device uses a minute pulse sensor on the index and central fingers to monitor the driver's heart rate. It calculates the average heartbeat, issuing warnings with vibrations and beeps if a significant decrease is detected. In case of a further decrease, indicating imminent sleep, the device activates with a loud sound. This stimulates physiological changes, increasing alertness and reducing drowsiness.

## Application
Compared to traditional methods like consuming caffeine or loud music, Anti-Snooze offers a safe and reliable solution to combat drowsiness. It outperforms common alternatives, such as coffee or energy drinks, without negative health effects. Unlike wearable devices, Anti-Snooze is placed on the steering wheel, minimizing the risk of loss.
